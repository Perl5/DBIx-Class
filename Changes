Revision history for DBIx::Class

    * New Features / Changes
        - Issue a warning when DateTime objects are passed to ->search
        - Fast populate() in void context is now even more efficient by
          going directly through execute_for_fetch bypassing execute_array
        - Fix update()/delete() on complex resultsets to no longer fall back
          to silly row-by-row deletion, construct a massive OR statement
          instead
        - Allow complex update/delete operations on sources without a
          primary key, as long as they have at least one non-nullable
          unique constraint

    * Fixes
        - Fix SkipFirst and FirstSkip limit dialects (Informix and Firebird)
        - Fix "Skimming limit" dialects (Top, FetchFirst) to properly check
          the order_by criteria for stability
        - Fix "Skimming limit" dialects (Top, FetchFirst) to propagate
          non-selected order criteria when part of a larger subquery
        - A number of corner case fixes of void context populate() with \[]
        - Fix corner case of forked children disconnecting the parents DBI
          handle
        - Fix leakage of $schema on in-memory new_related() calls
        - Remove useless vestigial pessimization in Ordered.pm for cases 
          when the position column is part of a unique constraint

    * Misc
        - Codebase is now trailing-whitespace-free
        - Cleanup of complex resultset update/delete oprations - storage
          specific code moved back to ResultSet and replaced by checks
          of storage capabilities

    * New Features / Changes
        - Allow schema cloning to mutate attributes
        - DBIC now attempts more aggressive de-duplication of where
          conditions on resultset chaining
        - The Ordered component is now smarter wrt reordering of dirty
          objects, and does its job with less storage queries
        - Logging via DBIC_TRACE=1=<filename> no longer overwrites the
          logfile on every program startup, appending loglines instead

    * Fixes
        - Fix issue where the query was becoming overly mangled when trying
          to use pagination with a query that has a sub-select in the WHERE
          clause
        - Fix possible incorrect pagination on Oracle, when a resultset
          is not ordered by a unique column
        - Revert "Fix incorrect signature of the default sqlt_deploy_hook"
          from 0.08191 - documentation was in fact incorrect, not the code
        - Fix Sybase ASE IC::DateTime support (::Storage going out of sync
          with new default format expected by DateTime::Format::Sybase)
        - Fix a bug in update_all() resulting in the first row receiving a

          require() (RT#68814)
        - Oracle autoinc inserts no longer leave open cursors behind

0.08192 2011-05-10 04:20 (UTC)
    * Fixes
        - Fix serious regression on SQLite, corrupting data when an alphanum
          value does not correspond to a stale numeric datatype in colinfo

0.08191 2011-05-02 00:45 (UTC) (deleted from CPAN)
    * New Features / Changes
        - Add quote_names connection option. When set to true automatically
          sets quote_char and name_sep appropriate for your RDBMS
        - Add retrieve_on_insert column info flag, allowing to retrieve any
          column value instead of just autoinc primary keys
        - Bring back strict ordering of selectors in complex search chains
          (an ill-fated attempt was made in 0.08127 to order intelligently)
        - All limit dialects (except for the older Top and FetchFirst) are
          now using bind parameters for the limits/offsets, making DBI's
          prepare_cached useful across paged resutsets
        - Support for savepoints for SQLite
        - Support for MS Access databases via DBD::ODBC and DBD::ADO (only
          Win32 support currently tested)
        - Support for the Firebird RDBMS over the new DBD::Firebird driver
        - IC::DateTime support for MSSQL over DBD::ADO
        - Both the ::ODBC and ::ADO dispatchers now warn if a rdbms-specific
          driver is not found for this connection before falling back to
          plain ::Storage::DBI
        - ::Storage::DBI::sth was mistakenly marked/documented as public,
          privatize and warn on deprecated use
        - Massive overhaul of bind values/attributes handling - slightly
          changes the output of as_query (should not cause compat issues)
        - Support ancient DB2 versions (5.4 and older), with proper limit
          dialect
        - Support sub-second precision for TIMESTAMPs for Firebird over ODBC
        - Support BLOBs and CLOBs in WHERE clauses for Oracle, including LIKE
          queries for CLOBs.

    * Fixes
        - Fix ::Storage::DBI::* MRO problems on 5.8.x perls
        - Disable mysql_auto_reconnect for MySQL - depending on the ENV
          it sometimes defaults to on and causes major borkage on older
          DBD::mysql versions
        - Fix dropped bind values in select/group_by on Oracle (omission
          from 0542ec57 and 4c2b30d6)
        - Fix remaining errors with Oracle and identifiers longer than the
          Oracle-imposed maximum of 30 characters (RT#66390)

          name quoting
        - Fix problems with M.A.D. under CGI::SpeedyCGI (RT#65131)

          in 0.08127
        - Better error handling when prepare() fails silently
        - Fixes skipped lines when a comment is followed by a statement
          when deploying a schema via sql file
        - Fix reverse_relationship_info on prototypical result sources
          (sources not yet registered with a schema)
        - Warn and skip relationships missing from a partial schema during
          dbic cascade_delete
        - Automatically require the requested cursor class before use
          (RT#64795)
        - Work around a Firebird ODBC driver bug exposed by DBD::ODBC 1.29
        - Fix (to the extent allowed by the driver) transaction support in
          DBD::Sybase compiled against FreeTDS
        - Fix exiting via next warnings in ResultSource::sequence()
        - Fix stripping of table qualifiers in update/delete in arrayref
          condition elements

        - Fix handling of rollbacks in nested transactions
        - Fix complex limits (RNO/RowNum/FetchFirst/Top/GenSubq) with
          sub-selects in the selectors list (correlated subqueries)
        - Fix inconsistency between $rs->next with and without HRI when all
          the "root" columns are in fact injected from the right rs side
        - Fix the join optimizer to correctly preserve the non-multi path to
          a multi relationship ( x -> might_have y -> has_many z )
        - Fix object-derived custom-relationship resultsets to resultsources
          with multilevel monikers (e.g. $schema->source('Foo::Bar') )
        - Fix incorrect signature of the default sqlt_deploy_hook - it now
          matches the documentation of passing in the result source object
        - Fix inadequate handling of internal storage methods within
          ::Storage::Replicated (RT#66295)

    * Misc
        - Rewire all warnings to a new Carp-like implementation internal
          to DBIx::Class, and remove the Carp::Clan dependency
        - Only load Class::C3 and friends if necessary ($] < 5.010)
        - Greatly reduced loading of non-essential modules to aid startup
          time (mainly benefiting CGI users)
        - Make sure all namespaces are clean of rogue imports
        - Dropped DBI req 2 years back - everything works with 1.57, no
          point requiring something newer

0.08190-TRIAL 2011-01-24 15:35 (UTC)

    * New Features / Changes

          in all types of relationships

0.08127 2011-01-19 16:40 (UTC)
    * New Features / Changes
        - Schema/resultsource instances are now crossreferenced via a new
          system guaranteeing leak-free mutually assured destruction
        - DBIx::Class now warns when the user erroneously supplies
          AutoCommit => 0 to connect()
        - A warning is also issued before forcing the RaiseError
          setting of externally supplied DBI handles
        - Switch to a warning when find() is invoked with both a 'key'
          argument and a NULL-containing condition to satisfy the named
          constraint. Previously (starting with 0.08124) an exception was
          thrown
        - Switch to a warning when a commit is attempted with an out-of-sync
          transaction_depth (someone issued a begin externally to DBIC).
          Previously (starting with 0.08124) an exception was thrown

    * Fixes
        - A number of improvements/diagnostics of multiple active resultset
          handling on MSSQL over DBD::ODBC
        - Revert default selection to being lazy again (eagerness introduced
          in 0.08125) - fixes DBIx::Class::Helper::ResultSet::RemoveColumns
        - Fix losing order of columns provided in select/as (regression from
          0.08125)
        - Unaliased "dark" selectors no longer throw off prefetch
        - Fix proper composition of bind values across all possible
          SQL areas ( group_by => \[ ... ] now works properly )
        - Allow populate to skip empty has_many relationships which makes
          it easier to pass HashRefInflator data directly to ->populate
        - Improve freeze/thaw semantics and error messages (RT#62546)
        - Fix inconsistency in Manual::Features (RT#64500)
        - Fix incorrect SQL when using for => 'shared' with MySQL (RT#64590)
        - Throw comprehensible exception on erroneous $schema->source()
          invocation
        - Fix sloppy refactor of ResultSource::sequence back from 89170201
          (RT#64839)
        - Fix incorrect error detection during populate() on Oracle
        - Better handling of result_source-less row objects by
          auto-calling result_source_instance when necessary
        - Fix reverse_relationship_info and sqlt deploy on partially
          loaded schemas (relationships point to non-existent sources)

          warning-free on all known OSes
        - Require newest namespace::clean which in turn depends on new
          installable Package::Stash

0.08126 2010-12-28 18:10 (UTC)

        - Do not run on smokers if a trial Package::Stash is found

0.08125 2010-12-27 04:30 (UTC)
    * New Features / Changes
        - New method ResultSource columns_info method, returning multiple
          pairs of column name/info at once
        - $rs->search now throws when called in void context, as it makes
          no sense (and is nearly always a sign of a bug/misdesign)
        - Restore long-lost ability to supply unbalanced select/as pairs
          e.g. +select => \'DISTINCT(foo, bar)', +as => ['foo', 'bar']
        - +columns now behaves just like columns by not stripping a
          fully-qualified 'as' spec (i.e. foo.bar results in $obj->foo->bar)
        - Deprecate legacy $rs->search( %condition ) syntax (warn once per
          callsite)
        - NULL is now supplied unquoted to all debug-objects, in order to
          differentiate between a real NULL and the string 'NULL'
        - New search() condition operator -value used to pass complex bind
          values to DBI: search({ array_col => { -value => [1,2,3] }})
        - Add full INSERT...RETURNING support for Oracle
        - Deprecate use of -nest in search conditions (warn once per

        - Fix incomplete logic while detecting correct Oracle sequence
          on insert
        - Fix detection of Oracle sequences for tables without an explicitly
          specified schema (RT#63493)
        - Major overhaul of Storage::Oracle to handle enabled quoting
        - Fixed incorrect composition of select/as/columns attributes during
          chaining (RT#61235)

        - Simplify SQL generated by some LIMITed prefetching queries
        - Throw an exception when a required group_by on a complex prefetch
          can not be auto-constructed, instead of continuing to eventually
          produce invalid SQL
        - Fix infinite loops on old perls with a recent Try::Tiny
        - Improve "fork()" on Win32 by reimplementing a more robust DBIC
          thread support (still problematic, pending a DBI fix)
        - Properly quote table name on INSERT with no values
        - Work around possible Storage destruction warnings
        - Fix count of grouped resultsets using HAVING with aliases
        - Setting belongs_to columns/relationships no longer leaves the
          FK value and related object out of sync
        - Stop stripping newlines from SQL statements in the limit emulators
          as it is possible that custom sql with comments was provided
        - Add forgotten attributes to Admin.pm
        - Fix incorrect 'having' attribute documentation (RT#64129)
        - Improve fallback-to-master/return-to-slave reporting in
          ::Replicated::Balancer
        - Adjust txn_scope_guard code/tests to changes in $@ handling on
          recent blead (RT#64251)

    * New Features / Changes
        - Add new -ident "function" indicating rhs is a column name
          { col => { -ident => 'othercol' } } vs { col => \'othercol' }
        - Extend 'proxy' relationship attribute
        - Use DBIx::Class::Storage::Debug::PrettyPrint when the
          environment variable DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE is set, see
          DBIx::Class::Storage for more information
        - Implemented add_unique_constraints() which delegates to
          add_unique_constraint() as appropriate
        - add_unique_constraint() now poparly throws if called with
          multiple constraint definitions
        - No longer depend on SQL::Abstract::Limit - DBIC has been doing
          most of the heavy lifting for a while anyway
        - FilterColumn now passes data through when transformations
          are not specified rather than throwing an exception.
        - Optimized RowNum based Oracle limit-dialect (RT#61277)
        - Requesting a pager on a resultset with cached entries now
          throws an exception, instead of returning a 1-page object
          since the amount of rows is always equal to the "pagesize"
        - $rs->pager now uses a lazy count to determine the amount of
          total entries only when really needed, instead of doing it
          at instantiation time
        - New documentation map organized by features
          (DBIx::Class::Manual::Features)
        - find( { ... }, { key => $constraint } ) now throws an exception
          when the supplied data does not fully specify $constraint
        - find( col1 => $val1, col2 => $val2, ... ) is no longer supported
          (it has been in deprecated state for more than 4 years)
        - Make sure exception_action does not allow exception-hiding
          due to badly-written handlers (the mechanism was never meant
          to be able to suppress exceptions)

    * Fixes
        - Fix memory leak during populate() on 5.8.x perls
        - Temporarily fixed 5.13.x failures (RT#58225)
          (perl-core fix still pending)
        - Fix result_soutrce_instance leaks on compose_namespace
        - Fix $_ volatility on load_namespaces (a class changing $_
          at compile time no longer causes a massive fail)
        - Fix find() without a key attr. choosing constraints even if
          some of the supplied values are NULL (RT#59219)
        - Fixed rels ending with me breaking subqueried limit realiasing
        - Fixed $rs->update/delete on resutsets constrained by an
          -or condition

        - Fix incorrect order_by handling with prefetch on
          $ordered_rs->search_related ('has_many_rel') resultsets
        - Oracle sequence detection now *really* works across schemas
          (fixed some ommissions from 0.08123)
        - dbicadmin now uses a /usr/bin/env shebang to work better with
          perlbrew and other local perl builds
        - bulk-inserts via $dbh->bind_array (void $rs->populate) now
          display properly in DBIC_TRACE
        - Incomplete exception thrown on relationship auto-fk-inference
          failures
        - Fixed distinct with order_by to not double-specify the same
          column in the GROUP BY clause
        - Properly support column names with symbols (e.g. single quote)
          via custom accessors
        - Fixed ::Schema::Versioned to work properly with quoting on
          (RT#59619)
        - Fixed t/54taint fails under local-lib
        - Fixed SELECT ... FOR UPDATE with LIMIT regression (RT#58554)
        - Fixed CDBICompat to preserve order of column-group additions,
          so that test relying on the order of %{} will no longer fail
        - Fixed mysterious ::Storage::DBI goto-shim failures on older
          perl versions
        - Non-blessed reference exceptions are now correctly preserved
          when thrown from udner DBIC (e.g. from txn_do)
        - No longer disconnecting database handles supplied to connect
          via a coderef
        - Fixed t/inflate/datetime_pg.t failures due to a low dependency
          on DateTime::Format::Pg (RT#61503)
        - Fix dirtyness detection on source-less objects
        - Fix incorrect limit_dialect assignment on Replicated pool members
        - Fix invalid sql on relationship attr order_by with prefetch
        - Fix primary key sequence detection for Oracle
          (first trigger instead of trigger for column)

        - Split sql statements for deploy only if SQLT::Producer returned a scalar
          containing all statements to be executed

          a configurable callback trigger
        - new order_by => { -desc => 'colname' } syntax supported
        - PG array datatype supported
        - insert should use store_column, not set_column to avoid marking
          clean just-stored values as dirty. New test for this

          hash construction algorithm
        - Allow explicit specification of ON DELETE/ON UPDATE constraints

          schemas) and, resultset_class and result_class in ResultSource.
          These accessors no longer automatically require the classes when
          set.
