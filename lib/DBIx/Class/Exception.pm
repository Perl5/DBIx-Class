=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Exception - Exception objects for DBIx::Class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exception objects of this class are used internally by
the default error handling of L<DBIx::Class::Schema/throw_exception>
and derivatives.

These objects stringify to the contained error message, and use
overload fallback to give natural boolean/numeric values.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 throw

=over 4

=item Arguments: $exception_scalar, $stacktrace

=back

This is meant for internal use by L<DBIx::Class>'s C<throw_exception>
code, and shouldn't be used directly elsewhere.

Expects a scalar exception message.  The optional argument
C<$stacktrace> tells it to output a full trace similar to L<Carp/confess>.

  DBIx::Class::Exception->throw('Foo');
  try { ... } catch { DBIx::Class::Exception->throw(shift) }

sub throw {
    my ($class, $msg, $stacktrace) = @_;

    # Don't re-encapsulate exception objects of any kind
    die $msg if ref($msg);

    # all exceptions include a caller
    $msg =~ s/\n$//;

    if(!$stacktrace) {
        # skip all frames that match the original caller, or any of
        # the dbic-wide classdata patterns
        my ($ln, $calling) = DBIx::Class::Carp::__find_caller(
          '^' . caller() . '$',
          'DBIx::Class',
        );

        $msg = "${calling}${msg} ${ln}\n";
    }
    else {
        $msg = Carp::longmess($msg);
    }

    my $self = { msg => $msg };
    bless $self => $class;

    die $self;
}

=head2 rethrow

This method provides some syntactic sugar in order to
re-throw exceptions.
