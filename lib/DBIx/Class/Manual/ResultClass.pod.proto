=head1 DESCRIPTION

In L<DBIx::Class>, a user normally receives query results as instances of a
certain C<Result Class>, depending on the main query source.  Besides being
the primary "toolset" for interaction with your data, a C<Result Class> also
serves to establish source metadata, which is then used during initialization
of your L<DBIx::Class::Schema> instance.

Because of these multiple seemingly conflicting purposes, it is hard to
aggregate the documentation of various methods available on a typical
C<Result Class>. This document serves as a general overview of C<Result Class>
declaration best practices, and offers an index of the available methods
(and the Components/Roles which provide them).
