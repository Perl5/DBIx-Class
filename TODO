 Add the search attributes "limit" and "rows_per_page".
 limit: work as expected just like offset does
 rows_per_page: only be used if you used the page attr or called $rs->page
 rows: modify to be an alias that gets used to populate either as appropriate,
       if you haven't specified one of the others
