# MASSIVE FIXME
# we can't really lock based on DSN, as we do not yet have a way to tell that e.g.
# DBICTEST_MSSQL_DSN=dbi:Sybase:server=192.168.0.11:1433;database=dbtst
#  and
# DBICTEST_MSSQL_ODBC_DSN=dbi:ODBC:server=192.168.0.11;port=1433;database=dbtst;driver=FreeTDS;tds_version=8.0
# are the same server
# hence we lock everything based on sqlt_type or just globally if not available
# just pretend we are python you know? :)


  # when we get a proper DSN resolution sanitize to produce a portable lockfile name
  # this may look weird and unnecessary, but consider running tests from
  # windows over a samba share >.>
  #utf8::encode($dsn);
  #$dsn =~ s/([^A-Za-z0-9_\-\.\=])/ sprintf '~%02X', ord($1) /ge;
  #$dsn =~ s/^dbi/dbi/i;

  # provide locking for physical (non-memory) DSNs, so that tests can
  # safely run in parallel. While the harness (make -jN test) does set
  # an envvar, we can not detect when a user invokes prove -jN. Hence
  # perform the locking at all times, it shouldn't hurt.
  # the lock fh *should* inherit across forks/subprocesses
  #
  # File locking is hard. Really hard. By far the best lock implementation
  # I've seen is part of the guts of File::Temp. However it is sadly not
  # reusable. Since I am not aware of folks doing NFS parallel testing,
  # nor are we known to work on VMS, I am just going to punt this and
  # use the portable-ish flock() provided by perl itself. If this does
  # not work for you - patches more than welcome.
