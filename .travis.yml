# Some overall notes on how this works
#
# * We smoke using the system provided latest, and custom built "oddball perls"
# The reason for not having a blanket matrix is to conserve travis resources
# as a full DBIC depchain isn't cheap
#
# * Minimum perl officially supported by DBIC is 5.8.3. This *includes* the
# basic depchain. On failure either attempt to fix it or bring it to the
# attention of ribasushi. *DO NOT* disable 5.8 testing - it is here for a
# reason
#
# * The matrix is built from two main modes - CLEANTEST = [true|false].
# - In the first case we test with minimal deps available, and skip everything
#   listed in DBIC::OptDesps. The modules are installed with classic CPAN
#   invocations and are *fully tested*. In other words we simulate what would
#   happen if a user tried to install on a just-compiled virgin perl
# - Without CLEANTEST we bring the armada of RDBMS and install the maximum
#   possible set of deps *without testing them*. This ensures we stay within
#   a reasonable build-time and still run as many of our tests as possible
#
# * The perl builds and the DBIC tests run under NUMTHREADS number of threads.
# The testing of dependencies under CLEANTEST runs single-threaded, at least
# until we fix our entire dep-chain to safely pass under -j
#
# * The way .travis.yml is fed to the command controller is idiotic - it
# makes using multiline `bash -c` statements impossible. Therefore to
# aid readability (our travis logic is rather complex), the bulk of
# functionality is moved to scripts. More about the problem (and the
# WONTFIX "explanation") here: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/497
