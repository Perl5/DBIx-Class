NAME
    DBIx::Class - Extensible and flexible object <-> relational mapper.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is an SQL to OO mapper, inspired by the Class::DBI framework, and
    meant to support compability with it, while restructuring the internals
    and making it possible to support some new features like self-joins,
    distinct, group bys and more.

    This project is still at an early stage, so the maintainers don't make
    any absolute promise that full backwards-compatibility will be
    supported; however, if we can without compromising the improvements
    we're trying to make, we will, and any non-compatible changes will merit
    a full justification on the mailing list and a CPAN developer release
    for people to test against.

QUICKSTART
    If you're using Class::DBI, and want an easy and fast way of migrating
    to DBIx::Class, take a look at DBIx::Class::CDBICompat.

    There are two ways of using DBIx::Class, the "simple" way and the
    "schema" way. The "simple" way of using DBIx::Class needs less classes
    than the "schema" way but doesn't give you the ability to easily use
    different database connections.

    Some examples where different database connections are useful are:

    different users with different rights different databases with the same
    schema.

  Simple
    First you need to create a base class which all other classes will
    inherit from. See DBIx::Class::DB for information on how to do this.

    Then you need to create a class for every table you want to use with
    DBIx::Class. See DBIx::Class::Table for information on how to do this.

  Schema
    With this approach, the table classes inherit directly from
    DBIx::Class::Core, although it might be a good idea to create a "parent"
    class for all table classes that inherits from DBIx::Class::Core and
    adds additional methods needed by all table classes, e.g. reading a
    config file or loading auto primary key support.

    Look at DBIx::Class::Schema for information on how to do this.
